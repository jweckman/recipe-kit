CAKE
1. Put the oats in a medium bowl with 300ml cold water and set aside to soak. 
2. Meanwhile, put the apples, coconut oil and 3 tbsp cold water in a large saucepan, cover with a lid and cook for 10 minutes over a medium heat until the apples have softened.
3. When the apples are soft, pour the soaked oats and soaking liquid into the pan, then stir in the cinnamon and milk. 
4. Turn the heat to low-medium and gently simmer the porridge for 15 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon regularly to stop the oats from sticking and clumping together.
5. When the porridge has a thick but stirrable consistency, take the pan off the heat and leave to stand for a minute before serving. 
6. Add a drizzle of honey, golden syrup or brown sugar to sweeten, if you like.
